# Simulation of Stelar Structure

This is a simulation of the stellar structure using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method and the polytrope assumption.
To run you must use python 3.8 and the following packages:  

numpy==1.21.5
pandas==1.3.5
scipy==1.7.3
matplotlib==3.5.3
seaborn==0.12.1

To use the program, simply run:
```bash
python starNum.py
```

This will output the graphs and data in the program's folder.
